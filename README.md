## Giftastic Descriptions
*  Condition-1: Without user input, if you press submit button than nothing will be add.
*  Condition-2: Filteration used, repeat animal or any word will not be add if you want to submit.
*  Fully mobile responsive application.
*  Bonus Point: Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.
*  When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static,non-animated gif images from      the GIPHY API.
*  When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks     the gif again, it should stop playing.
*  Every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

## Chalenging Point
*  Form text box consume more time to work accurate.
*  Submit button function give hard time.
*  Gifs pausing static and animated technique also consume more time but finish smoothly.
